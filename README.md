# Assignment 4

#Step 1
Navigation to the code, copy the code given in the file Dijkstra.cpp 
Using Terminal, go to the code with cd ls commands to run a project
or you can use rept.it/c++ to run this code

#Step 2:
Now you need to generate the output .

#Step 3:
After generating the output, its time to execute using ~output_file_name.out

#Step4:
The output is generated as it was given already while making the progrram

A video file is provided in this repository that shows the running algorithm of Dijkstra's Algorithm
